              Lumine is Aether’s older sister (by a few minutes, anyway) and it shows. She’s hot headed, fierce and protective, always chasing and kicking anyone who dared mess with Aether or any of her friends. Of course, such behavior was usually frowned upon, so she tried her best to police herself, but she still swears a lot and can’t cover up when anything annoys her. Despite that, she’s a great friend, always ready to lend an ear or a shoulder to cry on. Lumine’s love language is gift giving and she loves to go shopping, so everyone’s birthday gift is guaranteed. She also has a wild side, often explored in her OnlyFans account for only $9.99. If you want any free content that involves her swearing and raging, you can always come to her stream, where she’s often throwing off quizzical innuendos and swears whenever she dies on a Hades run.

          <p>
            Lumine and Aether’s upbringing was a complicated one - more often than not denied of their individuality and constantly traveling around, never making roots anywhere. The only thing that never changed for her was Aether and she was also the only thing that never changed for them. So, obviously, when Lumine started seeing specters, it was no surprise that Aether followed. Maybe it was the infamous twin connection, but soon enough it was confirmed to both of them that no one was crazy - Amber showed up soon enough in a flurry of flames.<br>
            After that, it was like if the sands of time started running and they were introduced to the guardian world and ended up separating due to Lumine’s natural gift for Geo. She was taken in by the adepti, training under the watchful eye of the Vigilant Yaksha, while living in the Wangshen Funeral Parlour’s backroom, courtesy of Hu Tao. Nowadays, she tries to balance her training, her OF and her streams along with visiting Aether from time to time.

          <p>
            Lumine usually keeps her hair chopped at shoulder length, sometimes letting her side bangs get longer than the rest of her hair just for kicks. Like Aether, she’s considered pretty - shiny golden hair, big and alluring eyes and (mostly) delicate looking. Lumine’s legs are a different story - they’re one of her strongest (literally and figuratively) assets and she’s not shy about exploiting her so-called “Absolute Territory” for money. Her wardrobe is usually composed of either very comfortable and long hoodies and sweaters or form-fitting co-ords and dresses.
